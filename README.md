This project utilizes automated testing tools to systematically retrieve and analyze pricing data for specific products across various e-commerce websites. By leveraging tools like Selenium and BeautifulSoup, the project automates the process of navigating websites, extracting product details including prices, and storing them for analysis.
Key steps include developing scripts to navigate each website, scrape relevant product information, and store it in a structured format.
Statistical analysis techniques are then applied to identify the lowest and highest prices observed for each product across the sampled websites.
The project aims to provide valuable insights into pricing dynamics, helping consumers make informed purchasing decisions based on real-time data. 
It also supports businesses in competitive analysis, enabling them to adjust pricing strategies accordingly to enhance market competitiveness.
Overall, the use of automated testing tools not only increases efficiency in data collection but also ensures accuracy and consistency in analyzing pricing variations across multiple e-commerce platforms. 
This approach enhances understanding of market trends and empowers stakeholders to optimize pricing strategies for better market positioning.
